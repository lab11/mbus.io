## How to update the website

The makefile should do all the heavy lifting, with the makefile you can:

 * `make develop`: Host a copy of the website on your local machine.
    Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to view it.
    Any changes you make will automatically cause the site to rebuild,
    simply refresh your browser to see them.
 * `make deploy`: Pushes an update to the live [mbus.io](http://mbus.io) site.
    It will open an editor window with a summary of the files you changed.
    You will need to write a (breif) message explaining the change, save, and quit.
    Be careful with this, it takes effect immediately.


### Resources

For things that you want on the live website, place them in `templates/static/{folder}/{file}`.
Only put files that should be available online inside of the `templates` folder.
For things like full-resoultion images, gimp/photoshop files, use the `resources` folder.

## Pre-requisites

You'll need to install a few python packages:

`sudo pip install staticjinja when-changed`
